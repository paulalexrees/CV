A live events technician turned Junior Developer via Makers Academy. I've gone from teaching myself Objective-C in my parents' basement to pushing myself to acquire the skills to forge a career I enjoy.

I like to know how everything works, and use that knowledge to formulate ideas for improvement. Despite often resulting in getting myself in too deep, it always allows room for learning something new or finding a different perspective.

## Skills

##### Full Stack Development

- Keen for clean, readable code
- Reliable code using Test-Driven Development
- Building expandable software with Object-Oriented Programming
- Communicative pair partner
- Deconstructing problems to get to the root of them
- Finding challenging new ideas to implement into whatever I'm doing to always keep me thinking

##### Learning Things

- Learnt Ruby and Javascript and accompanying test frameworks over the course of 12 weeks.
- Quick learner of other OO languages thanks to the practices taught at Makers Academy.

##### Dealing With Things

- I hate panicking, so I try very hard not to. My career in live events gave me a degree of unflappability that allows me to remain calm in problematic situations and to address them methodically.
- I like to know what I'm getting myself in for when attempting new things, whether it be 'spiking' a test version or simply reading tutorials and example code - I like to be well informed.
