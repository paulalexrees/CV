## Paul Rees

A live events technician turned junior developer via Makers Academy, I've gone from an attempt to teach myself Objective-C at home to pushing myself out into the real world to learn from and work with great people.

I like to know how everything works, and use that knowledge to formulate ideas for improvement. Despite often resulting in getting myself in too deep, it always allows room for learning something new or finding a different perspective.

## Skills

#### Full Stack Development

- Keen for clean, readable code
- Reliable code using Test-Driven Development
- Building expandable software with Object-oriented programming
- Communicative pair partner
- Deconstructing problems to get to the root of them
- Finding challenging new ideas to implement into whatever I'm doing to always keep me thinking

#### Learning

- Quick learner of other OO languages thanks to the practices taught at Makers Academy
- For a challenge, as a project team we taught ourselves Node.js for our back end in just a few days, and with only 2 weeks of learning Javascript


#### Dealing with things

- I hate panicking, so I try very hard not to. My career in live events gave me a degree of unflappability that allows me to remain calm in a problematic situation - giving up is never an option.
