## Paul Rees

I am a Junior Web Developer, recently graduated from Makers Academy. The past 3 months have fuelled my enthusiasm for code creation and design. Looking for somewhere I can test this knowledge and learn a whole lot more in a fun and inspiring environment.

## Skills

#### Full Stack Development

- Keen for clean, readable code
- Making life easier with Test-Driven Development
- Building expandable software with Object-oriented programming
- Quick learner of other OO languages thanks to the practices taught at Makers Academy
- A frank but fun pair partner
- Deconstructing problems to get to the root of them
- Finding challenging new ideas to implement into whatever I'm doing to always keep me thinking

#### Another Skill - Do I need more stuff here?

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
